  <h2>ABOUT ME</h2>
  <h3>Background</h3>
    <h5>Last Updated on April 28, 2018: 11:13:56 pm.</h5>
    <p>I am moffat, and i am the fifth son of Richard Ombasa, a local church elder; and Deconess Euniah Monyag'i.<p/>
  <h3>Education Background</h3>
  <p>I am  graduate of Technical University of Technology, TUK. I actively undertook Bachelor of Engineering in Electrical and Electronic Engineering. I have been in Tuk for 6 years, sicne 2012. I have gained much knowledge of the same, and i wanna corporate the coding and the electrical skills i have to move up in the academic ladder.</p>
  <p> <em><strong>"The world of computers is growing at an un-recordable rate"</em></strong>. Everyday, computers are the most influential tools in our lives, they are our present and future. In my opinion nothing on the planet can measure the exponential growth and excitement in the computing industry, and industry which I want to be a part of, particularly Software Engineering.<p/>
<h3>Why I Am In Moringa</h3>
  <p>As long as computers are around, Software Engineering will take place after all, people need to write and code the programs like Microsoft Word, and code your games, they donâ€™t just appear. My goal is to be part of a team who creates worthwhile, efficient and useful software for consumers. And the Engineering course if I work at it, which I will, will be the key to my success, my current computing A-Level course is a good first step for my goal.</p>
  <p>Currently, I am enrolled at moringa school, and I have learned many things while studying here. While i cannot call myself an expert, i have done some simple projects. The major courses that i have learned so far include the following: </p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>HTML and CSS</strong></li>It was from this knowledge that i actually made my first ever site! you can view it <a href="https://github.com/MoffatOmbasa/hi-moff">by clicking here<a/>
      <li><strong>Divs and Spans</strong></li>With which i have  made this website! actually, this site is full of Divs an Spans. Divs are for grouping a large section of pages, which we can call divisions and spans are for grouping small sections, usually inline blocks.
      <li><strong>Git and Github</strong></li>A useful tool to track the code and store the code. I have known how to add a <em>code to a remote respiratory, clone a code, push a code, mak a commit and make a branch in Github</em>
    </ul>
